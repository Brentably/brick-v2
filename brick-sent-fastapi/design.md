Ok, we'll start step by step. 

Goals:
- [] Get OpenAI or Claude to produce a sentence based on some arbitrary number from the frequency list
- [] Allow the user to input their interpreted translation
- [] get a rough score for this translation (pass/fail)
- loop


As time goes on we'll move onto: 
- Big problem: how to generate sentences faster
- Big problem: can we really just ignore tracking grammar?
- Big problem: how do we go about storing users learning states?
